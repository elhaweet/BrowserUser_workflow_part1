Agentic AI: Automated Data Scraping & Cleaning 🚀
This repository contains the code for an AI-powered agent that automates data scraping, cleaning, and structuring using the browser-use repository. The agent navigates web pages, extracts relevant data, processes it, and outputs structured results—fully autonomously!

🚀 Features
✔️ Automated Web Scraping – Extracts data from websites dynamically.
✔️ Data Cleaning & Structuring – Prepares and organizes scraped data.
✔️ Browser Automation – Uses browser-use for seamless navigation.
✔️ Fully Autonomous – Runs without manual intervention.

📌 How It Works
The AI agent launches a browser and navigates to the target website.
It scrapes relevant data based on predefined rules.
Extracted data is cleaned, formatted, and structured into a usable format.
The final dataset is stored in a CSV/JSON file for further analysis.
